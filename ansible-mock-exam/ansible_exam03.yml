# We have php, nginx and mariadb installed on node02 and have a DB mydb created there.
# The user to connect to DB is myuser and password is mypassword.

# Create a playbook ~/playbooks/database.yml to perform below given tasks:
# a. Start nginx and mariadb services.

# b. Delete all default files/directories from nginx document root /usr/share/nginx/html/

# c. Download a zip archive from https://github.com/indercodes/ansible-1100-mock-nginx/raw/master/index.php.zip and extract it in /usr/share/nginx/html/

# d. The archive have an index.php file to check DB connectivity. Replace some required DB details in the file using replace or lineinfile module:

# $database = "database"; to $database = "mydb";

# $username = "user"; to $username = "myuser";

# $password = "password"; to $password = "mypassword";

# e. Restart nginx after making required changes.
