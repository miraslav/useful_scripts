# Write a playbook ~/playbooks/logrotate.yml to configure log-rotation on remote hosts.

# Complete the following tasks:

# grab the module from GitHub: https://github.com/arillso/ansible.logrotate 
# Use ansible-galaxy install command install inside /home/thor/playbooks/roles If you stumbled upon the issue, could not find/use git, 
# install git in the ansible-runner first and install the role.

# configure your log rotation rules as:

# daily
# rotate 3
# compress
# â€¦to rotate a log file that would present on location /var/log/myapp.log


# That means rotate daily, compress the log file and keep the last three rotations.
# Check on the options section that the role provides.
# Since this role depends on facts on remote hosts, make sure to gather facts is not false.


# install the role using ansible-galaxy
# ansible-galaxy install git+https://github.com/arillso/ansible.logrotate --roles-path ~/playbooks/roles

# Update roles/ansible.logrotate/defaults/main.yml and modify logrotate_applications section as below:

logrotate_applications:
  - name: myapp
    definitions:
      - logs:
          - /var/log/myapp.log
        options:
          - daily
          - rotate 3
          - compress

# Create logrotate.yml playbook and add below given code
---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - ansible.logrotate
