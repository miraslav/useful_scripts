Discuss how to secure sensitive data in a Kubernetes cluster.

Cluster Maintenance

Explain how to backup and restore a Kubernetes cluster.
Discuss the different approaches to scaling a Kubernetes cluster.
Explain how to monitor the health of a Kubernetes cluster.
Discuss how to diagnose and resolve common issues in a Kubernetes cluster.

Applications and Services

Explain how to deploy an application on a Kubernetes cluster.
Discuss the different types of Kubernetes objects and when to use them.
Explain how to expose a service to the external network in a Kubernetes cluster.
Discuss how to manage and roll out updates to applications in a Kubernetes cluster.

Storage

Discuss the different types of Persistent Volume Claims and when to use them.
Explain how to configure storage for stateful applications in a Kubernetes cluster.
Please note that this is not an exhaustive list and the actual questions on the CKA exam may vary. Additionally, this list is based on my training data and some questions may have changed or been updated since my training cutoff.

It's also worth mentioning that the CKA exam will also test your understanding of how to debug, troubleshoot and resolve common problems in a Kubernetes cluster. Here are a few sample questions in this area:

Debugging

Explain how to use kubectl to debug an application in a Kubernetes cluster.
Discuss how to view logs of a Kubernetes object.
Explain how to diagnose network issues in a Kubernetes cluster.

Troubleshooting

Explain how to diagnose resource utilization issues in a Kubernetes cluster.
Discuss common reasons for pods failing to start or restart.
Explain how to resolve issues with persistent storage in a Kubernetes cluster.

Resolving problems

Explain how to resolve a deadlock in a Kubernetes cluster.
Discuss common reasons for nodes to become unresponsive and how to resolve them.
Explain how to recover from a lost etcd quorum in a Kubernetes cluster.
This list should give you a good idea of the types of questions you can expect on the CKA exam, as well as the topics that will be covered. However, it's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the actual questions on the exam may vary. The best way to prepare for the exam is to gain a deep understanding of the Kubernetes platform and its various components and features, as well as the best practices for deploying and managing applications in a production environment.


Finally, it's also important to be familiar with the different tools and resources that are used in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Here are a few sample questions in this area:

Tools

Discuss the different tools used for managing a Kubernetes cluster, such as kubectl, kubeadm, and kops.
Explain the purpose of Kubernetes dashboards and how to use them.
Discuss the different tools used for monitoring a Kubernetes cluster, such as Prometheus and Grafana.

Resources

Explain the role of the Kubernetes community and its various resources, such as the Kubernetes website, mailing lists, and slack channels.
Discuss the different resources available for learning more about Kubernetes, such as online courses, books, and tutorials.
Explain the role of the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) program and its benefits.
This should give you an idea of the types of questions you may encounter regarding the Kubernetes ecosystem and the tools and resources that are used in the platform. It's important to be familiar with these resources and tools as they can be valuable in your day-to-day work with Kubernetes, as well as in your preparation for the CKA exam.

Remember, the goal of the CKA exam is to test your hands-on experience and proficiency with the Kubernetes platform, so be sure to spend plenty of time practicing and deploying applications on a real or simulated Kubernetes cluster. Good luck!
